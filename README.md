# Abyss
A dark color scheme for micro modeled after the Abyss VSCode theme.

[How Abyss looks in VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-Abyss)

## Installation
From your micro editor, press `CtrlE` and type this command:

`> plugin install abyss`

After the plugin has been installed, set the colorscheme with:

`> set colorscheme abyss`

Note that for the color scheme to work properly you should have the following environment variables set, as well as a truecolor-compatible terminal (I use Wezterm):

`export COLORTERM=truecolor`

`export MICRO_TRUECOLOR=1`
